# Monads in javascript

Can you explain a monad to a junior so they can actually write one themselves?

I can't.

So, I've decided that finally I want to be able to use the Feynman technique to
explain them, and am starting again at the beginning to see, what have I missed?

Why am I unable to explain them clearly? As Richard Feynman rightly points out,
**I must not understand them well enough**.
